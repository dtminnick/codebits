## Solution

#### Load Libraries

This solution uses the `dplyr`, `knitr` and `stringr` libraries.  The code chunk below checks for installation and, if needed, will install the libraries and load them.  The `ggplot` library is used to generate the plot at the end of this example.

```{r load_libraries, message = FALSE}
packages <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "stringr")

installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())

if(any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
  
}

invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```
