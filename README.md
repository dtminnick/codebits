# Code Bits Collection
This repo is a personal collection of small code snippets, functions, and scripts used for testing concepts, prototyping ideas, or solving one-off problems during data, analysis, and automation projects. It includes code in R and Python and supports my broader work in process improvement and data science.

# What's Inside
Each file represents a "code bit"â€”a small, focused piece of logic meant to:
- Explore functionality (e.g., reading unusual file formats, basic automation),
- Prototype tools (e.g., workbook formatting, ETL steps), or
- Act as utilities in larger projects.

Files are accompanied by markdown files that show the code applied to a use case.

# R Bits

[Count active events](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/count_by_hour_interval.md) by hour interval.

[Create a Likert diverging stacked bar chart](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/likert_diverging_stacked_chart.md) using the `ggstats` library.

[Create a raincloud chart](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/raincloud_chart.md) to visualize variation.

[Create a sankey chart](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/sankey_chart.md) to visualize a process flow.

[Generate a calendar table](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/create_calendar_table.md) using the `dplyr` library.

[Generate a frequency distribution table](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/frequency_distribution_table.md) using the `dplyr` library.

[List and import files](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/list_and_extract_aws_files.md) from the Amazon cloud storage using the `aws.s2` library.

[Reconcile record counts](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/file_reconciliation.md) when combining multiple files.
